# Nyx - a new PDDL+ planner written in Python

Nyx is a PDDL+ parser and planner written in python with a focus on simplicity. It is a discretization-based planner that approximates the continuous system dynamics using uniform time steps (Î”t) and step functions.


This work was based on the classical parser and planner written by PUCRS (https://github.com/pucrs-automated-planning/pddl-parser).

## Parser execution
```Shell
python -B nyx.py ex/car/car.pddl ex/car/pb01.pddl -t:1 -v
```

## Current limitations of our planner
- No support for Timed-Initial Literals/Fluents (TILs/TIFs)
- No support for durative actions (since they can be represented equivalently by instantaneous actions and a process (start-process-stop paradigm))
- No support for object subtypes
- No negated predicates in problem file's :init
